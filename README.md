## Font Viewer ##

FontViewer is an iOS font catalogue app. The idea of the app is to display the fonts which are present in the `+(NSArray *)familyNames` method of UIFont. 

In the Settings page, you will be able to apply various settings to the way the fonts are being displayed.

#### Text Alignment Settings ####

Options are LEFT or RIGHT. LEFT option will set the cell label to be aligned to the left. RIGHT option will set the cell label to be aligned to the right.

#### Reverse Character Settings ####

Options are ON or OFF. Setting reverse character to ON will print the character names of the string in reverse. Setting reverse character OFF will print the font names in the usual left-to-right order.

#### Sort By Settings ####
